This project will allow you to create custom Gridfinity divider bins.


## Installation

Clone the repo and install requirements from `requirements.txt`. It is _highly_ recommended to use a virtual environment for this. Read [this](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) for more details.

> Note that this requires Python >=3.8.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Look at [`generate.py`](generate.py) for usage examples for now.

Run it with

```
python3 generate.py
```

## Contribution

This is my first time using Cadquery so I'm sure it is far from optimal. Feel free to submit PRs to get it cleaner.
